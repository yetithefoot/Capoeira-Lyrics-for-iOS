ShareKit 2.0
============

In order to make it easier for new users to choose a canonical fork of ShareKit, the ShareKit community has decided to band together and take responsibility for collecting useful commits into what we're calling "ShareKit 2.0". It is now ready for you. It is the first officially stable version of ShareKit since February, with more frequent updates expected.

Highlights:

* new sharers (FourSquare, LinkedIn, VKontakte)
* Twitter on iOS 5 uses system dialogue
* many other improvements, mostly stability and memory issues
* optimized for adding as git submodule to your project for easy updating

You can follow the initial planning at https://github.com/ideashower/ShareKit/issues/283.

As ShareKit is now community driven, you are welcome to help, to judge new features, review pull requests etc.. There are many ways you can help, see [FAQ](https://github.com/ShareKit/ShareKit/wiki/FAQ)
